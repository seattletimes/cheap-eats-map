    "description": "This rustic chic restaurant does slight tweaks on comfort food and the classics, from avocado toast to a beef-tongue French Dip, but most order the\"New School Burger'- two patties stacked with Beecher's cheese and a foliage of arugula and pickled onions on a Macrina ciabatta. It's the usual gooey, salty, greasy double burger but made distinctive with a secret sauce that tastes like a cross between an aioli and salsa verde. The kitchen also smokes its own salmon and bacon.  ",

    "description": "From the owners of popular Seattle food truck Fish Basket, this Burien restaurant is a hit. Housed in an eclectic mini-mall, the focus here is fish, from classic fried seafood and chips to lobster and crab rolls. Don't miss the fried cod tacos, thin and crispy, and swimming in a tangy pico de gallo.",
