    "description": "The extra “o” in Ooink comes from the surname of chef Chong Boon Ooi, who meticulously assembles each bowl of ramen at his tiny shop, using metal chopsticks to gently, swiftly turn the noodles, adding toppings with precision. His business partner (and wife) Jiaxin Wang says that their spicy kotteri ramen is the most clamored for, made with extra-luscious broth courtesy of se-abura (pork back fat). The miso ramen inspires awe with its delicate richness. At Ooink, you may very well find the best bowl of ramen you’ve ever had. ",

It’s a testament to the food’s quality that a sold-out crowd has discovered the Peruvian/Mexican restaurant, hidden away in a strip-mall grocery store. "

The chewy discs of rice cake with rich lamb curry are especially good. Scrutinizing the erupting Mount Rainier diorama is free. ",
